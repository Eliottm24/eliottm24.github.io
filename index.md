## About Me

My name is Eliott Morales and I am a student at California State Fullerton. I am majoring in Computer Science.

## Projects

- [Project 1](https://github.com/cpsc-spring-2024/cpsc-120-lab-08-eliott-and-joshua.git): The "Olympic Judge Average" project attracted my interest since it exposed me to a real-world scenario involving an average score while removing the highest and lowest numbers. I learned how to use a sorting algorithm to efficiently identify the lowest and highest ratings. Additionally, dealing with command-line parameters improved my comprehension of program input handling.

- [Project 2](https://github.com/cpsc-spring-2024/cpsc-120-lab-09b-eliott-and-isaac.git): The "Spell Checker" program was an intriguing experiment that went into the practical use of text processing. I developed a better knowledge of file input/output operations and vector manipulation. Furthermore, using the spell-checking logic boosted my problem-solving abilities.

- [Project 3](https://github.com/cpsc-spring-2024/cpsc-120-lab-05-javen-eliott.git): The "Calculating the Area of a Rectangle" experiment taught me the fundamentals of modular programming. Breaking down the code into distinct files and building unit tests helped me develop a better grasp of code organization and verification methodologies. This lab stressed the necessity of structured development and testing processes, which are required for creating dependable and maintainable software.
